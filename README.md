Introduction:

👋 Hi there! I'm Vikas Reddy, a passionate learner exploring the fascinating world of Deep Learning and Neural Networks. Through my journey, I've delved into the fundamental concepts that power Deep-Learning.

What I've Learned So Far:

🧠 My exploration includes topics such as Deep Learning, Shallow and deep Neural Networks, Supervised Learning, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, Derivatives, Vectorization, and Activation Functions. These concepts form the backbone of modern DL systems, enabling machines to learn and make predictions.

📚 I've compiled detailed notes capturing key insights and practical knowledge. These notes are available right here on my GitHub profile. Feel free to explore and use them in your learning journey.

Note Credits:

🙏 Special thanks to Andrew Ng for his invaluable contributions to the field of machine learning. My notes draw inspiration from his teachings, and I'm excited to share my understanding with the community.
